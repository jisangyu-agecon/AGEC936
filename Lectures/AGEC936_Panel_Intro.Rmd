# Introduction: My goals here are...

* To bring various (and mostly recent) empirical issues related to panel data analyses to your attention

* To help you become a critical consumer and a careful producer of empirical studies

* Not necessarily "teach" you new methods -- I will provide various frameworks for carefully thinking about these empirical issues and point you to the relevant literature.

*These being said, you may will leave this module with more questions than answers after this module...*

# Panel data: an introduction

- Data structure

$$
Y=\begin{pmatrix}y_{11} & y_{21} & ... & y_{N1} \\
y_{12} & y_{22} & ... & y_{N2} \\
. & . &  ... & . \\
. & . &  ... & . \\
. & . &  ... & . \\
y_{1T} & y_{2T} & ... & y_{NT} 
\end{pmatrix},
\;\;\; D=\begin{pmatrix}d_{11} & d_{21} & ... & d_{N1} \\
d_{12} & d_{22} & ... & d_{N2} \\
. & . &  ... & . \\
. & . &  ... & . \\
. & . &  ... & . \\
d_{1T} & d_{2T} & ... & d_{NT} 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

- Consider the following data generating process:

$$
\begin{align}
y_{it}=\alpha+\rho d_{it}+\varepsilon_{it}
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon_{it}=\gamma x_i + u_{it}
\end{align}
$$

- A quick review question: Under what condition we face an **omitted variable bias**?

# A simple simulation: Set up
- Set-up:
$$
\begin{align}
y_{it}=0.5+10 d_{it}+0.2x^2_{i}+u_{it}\;\;\text{with}\;\;i=\{1,2,...,500\}\;\;\text{and}\;\;t=\{1,2\}
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
d_{it}= \begin{cases}
1\;\;\text{if}\;\;x_{i}>5.5\;\;\text{and}\;\;t=2 \\
0\;\;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
x_{i}\;\sim\;U(1,10),\;\;\text{and}\;\;u_{it}\;\sim\;N(0,1)
\end{align}
$$

- From the DGP, we have
$$
\begin{align}
y_{it}=\alpha+\rho d_{it}+f(x_i) + u_{it}
\end{align}
$$
which can be rewritten as
$$
\begin{align}
y_{it}=\alpha+\rho d_{it}+v_i + u_{it} \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$
A quick insight: The functional form of $f$ does not matter as long as its argument is a time-invariant variable specific to each cross-sectional unit. We can always replace $f(x_i)$ with $v_i$. *But, how about the functional form of $y$ itself? (Imai and Kim 2019, AJPS)*

- **Least Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV)** estimator:
$$
\begin{align}
y_{it}=\alpha+\rho d_{it}+\sum_i c_i I_i + u_{it}
\end{align}
$$
where $I_i$ is the indicator variables for each cross-sectional unit. Estimate this equation by OLS. 

- **Within/Fixed Effects (FE)** estimator:
$$
\begin{align}
y_{it}-\bar{y}_{i}=\rho (d_{it}-\bar{d}_{i})+ u_{it} \tag{2}
\end{align}
$$
where
$$
\begin{align}
\bar{y}_{i}=\alpha+\rho\bar{d}_{i}+v_i+ \bar{u}_{i}. \tag{3}
\end{align}
$$
with $\bar{x}_{i}=\frac{1}{T}\sum_t x_{i}$. Note that equation (3) is the **within** average of equation (1) (i.e. average over $t$ within $i$) and equation (2) is equation (1) minus equation (3).

- **LSDV** vs **FE**
  + Two estimators are **numerically identical**.
  + LSDV can be computationally expensive.
  
# FE/LSDV: Identifying assumptions and some asymptotics
$$
\begin{align}
y_{it}=\alpha+\rho d_{it}+v_i + u_{it}
\end{align}
$$

- Identifying assumptions
  1. Strict exogeneity, $E(u_{it}|d_{i1}, d_{i2},...,d_{iT})=0$: This precludes the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable as an additional regressor.
  2. The regressor, $d_{it}$, needs to vary within each cross-sectional unit over time.

- Unbiasedness and asymptotics
  + Under the identifying assumptions, $\hat{\rho}$ from LSDV or FE estimators is **unbiased**.
  + With $N \rightarrow \infty$, $\hat{\rho}$ is **consistent**.
  + With $N \rightarrow \infty$, $\hat{c}_i$ is **inconsistent** (we need $T \rightarrow \infty$). Why? The number of parameters increases as $N \rightarrow \infty$.

# A couple of notes on First Difference (FD) estimator
$$
\begin{align}
y_{it}-y_{it-1}=\rho (d_{it}-d_{it-1})+ (u_{it}-u_{it-1})
\end{align}
$$

* With $T=2$, LSDV, FE, and FD are identical.
* With $T>2$, LSDV and FE are in general more efficient.
* Somewhat weaker identifying assumption than FE/LSDV, sequential exogeneity: $E(u_{it}|d_{it}, d_{it-1})=0$
* In practice, very little difference between the two identifying assumptions (i.e. there are not many cases one assumption holds and the other does not). The only exception is when you need to work with the lagged dependent variable. The sequential exogeneity still precludes the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable but allows the use of instrumental vairables.   
  

# FE, LSDV, and FD: An example

```{stata third, collectcode=TRUE}
*Declare the data as panel
xtset id t

*FE
xtreg y d, fe

*LSDV
areg y d, absorb(id)

*FD
reg d.y d.d, nocon robust
```

*We see the numerical equivalence between* **FE**, **LSDV**, *and*, **FD**.

# When the Panel FE approach fails?

- Let's start with some obvious ones:
  + Time-varying confounders (violating the identifying assumption 1): 
  $$
  \begin{align}
  y_{it}=\alpha+\rho d_{it}+v_i+\eta_{it}+ u_{it}\;\;\text{and}\;\;Cov(d_{it},\eta_{it}) \neq 0
  \end{align}
  $$
  
    + *It violates the strict exogeneity.*
    + *Possible solutions?: time fixed effects (multiway fixed effects -- we will discuss this more later), time trends, unit- or group-specific time trends*
  
  + Time-invariant regressors (violating the identifying assumption 2):
  $$
  \begin{align}
  y_{it}=\alpha+\rho d_{i}+v_i+ u_{it}
  \end{align}
  $$
  
    + *We cannot distinguish the effect of $d_i$ from $v_i$.*
    + *Possible solution?: Correlated Random Effects if you have both* **time-variant** *and* **time-invariant** *covariates (but different identifying assumption: $E(v_i|\bar{z}_i)=0$ where $\bar{z}_i$ is the time-average of observable time-variant covariates)*
  
  + Violating the linearity assumption: Instead of equation (1), we can have
  $$
  \begin{align}
  y_{it}=g(d_{it},v_i,u_{it})
  \end{align}
  $$
  
    + *Alternative approach: Panel matching estimator [@imai2019should]*
  
# Less obvious ones, especially when $T>2$, [@imai2019should]
 
*Under the assumption of $d_{it}$ are sequentially related... (see Figure 2 of @imai2019should)*
  
1. Dynamics in outcomes: $y_{is}$ for $s<t$ affects $y_{it}$

2. "Carryover": $d_{is}$ for $s<t$ affects $y_{it}$
  
3. "Feedback": $y_{is}$ for $s<t$ affects $d_{it}$

*These all lead to the violation of Assumption 1, conditional strict exogeneity ($E(u_{it}|d_{i1}, d_{2t},...,d_{iT},x_i)=0$).*

**Possible solutions?**

   - Controlling for past $d_{it}$: Can mitigate 1 and 2... but how many lags?
   - Controlling for past $y_{it}$: Can mitigate 3, but needs instruments and additional assumptions.
  
# Dynamic panel
  $$
  \begin{align}
  y_{it}=\alpha+\beta y_{it-1}+\rho d_{i}+v_i+ u_{it}
  \end{align}
  $$

- FE/FD is inconsistent with $N \rightarrow \infty$ with fixed $T$

- Possible solution: Panel GMM with previous outcomes as instruments [@arellano1991some]. The moment conditions are 
  $$
  \begin{align}
  E(y_{is}\Delta \varepsilon_{it})=0\;\;\text{for}\;\;s\leq t-2
  \end{align}
  $$
